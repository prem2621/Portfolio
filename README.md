This was my **first-ever portfolio website**, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to introduce myself to the world as a web developer 🌍.  
Clean, responsive, and filled with passion — this portfolio reflects my early steps in front-end development and creative design.

## 💡 Reflection – A Piece of My Journey

> ✍️ *“I built this portfolio not to impress, but to express. At the time, I didn’t know frameworks, responsiveness was new to me, and I made a lot of visual design mistakes too. But I still hit ‘Deploy’ — and that changed everything.*  
>
> *Today, I look back at this portfolio and smile — because this is where I told the world, ‘Hey, I’m Prem. And I’m ready to build.’*  
>
> *This site may be version one, but it was version one of a developer who kept going. And that’s all that matters.”*
